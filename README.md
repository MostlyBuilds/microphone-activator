# Device Info
This device is a phantom powered microphone preamp, commonly called a microphone
activator. Devices like this are frequently used to boost quiet microphones
before the signal gets to an audio interface.

# Circuit Info
This circuit uses two LSK389C JFETs as a two-stage amplifier in what is referred
to as the [cascode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascode) configuration. All of
the components are of the SMT variety, with the resistors and capacitors in the
1206 package size.

For more details regarding the specific parts used, please refer to the YouTube
series. Each video in the series contains links in the description for parts
and tools that are relevant to the video.

# YouTube Video Series
This project was created as part of a YouTube video series that walks through
the teardown of a real CL-1, and the process of creating the circuit and a
custom PCB variant in KiCad.
